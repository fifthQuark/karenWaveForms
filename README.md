# KarenWaveForms

KarenWaveForms is a simple web-based waveform visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was originally created as part of the Churchill fall musical, **SpongeBob**, to animate Karen's face with waveform visuals.

## Features

- **Waveform Visualization**: Uses HTML5's `<canvas>` element to display waveform graphics, generated based on audio frequency data.
- **Two Visualization Options**:
  - **canvasFreq.js**: The recommended file to use for waveform visualizations.
  - **canvasDom.js**: An alternative, though not fully functional, as it primarily responds to volume rather than creating accurate frequency-based visuals.
- **Simple Setup**: Just link the relevant files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to get a basic waveform visual on a webpage.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and open the html file in your browser
2. Open https://fifthquark.github.io/karenWaveForms/
- Note: Chromium based browsers need to install it as a PWA in this moment
